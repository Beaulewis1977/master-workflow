# Contributing to {{PRODUCT_NAME}}

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project!

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](//github.com/{{GITHUB_REPO}}/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](//github.com/{{GITHUB_REPO}}/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Open a new issue with the title "Enhancement: [Your suggestion]".
- Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you are proposing.

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
