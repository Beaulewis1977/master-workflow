# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Please follow these guidelines:

- Open an issue first for significant changes; link to relevant plan sections (e.g., `GPT5-PLAN.MD`).
- Keep PRs focused and small; include tests and docs updates.
- Run tests locally: `npm test` (Node 18/20). Lint: `npm run lint`.
- Do not include secrets in commits. Follow security policy in `SECURITY.md`.
- CI must pass across OS matrix before approval.
- Follow the code style in the repository. Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Use the default MCP server `context7` for libraries unless explicitly overridden.
