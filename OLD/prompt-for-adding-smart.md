we need to add some features to these workflows. and then we need to test them.

analyze these documents. they shouldnt be followed 100% as they may be wrong. but theyre an idea to add smart logic engine to deeply analyze the codebase or the new build documents and highly customize all documents involved with the worflow.
the markdown files from agent-os, to the claude code sub agents, to the json files, to the instruction files for how everything coordinates, communicates and works together.
it will also have to figure out which version of claude code flow. theres many versions and every job doesnt need the full sparc or full stack version. so there must be a way
to decide which version to install. but also a way for the user to give a prompt or the workflow or script asks the user which version to install. so e need multiple ways to determine but most improtant
is an intelligent and smart way for the agent/script to decide wwhich version to install for that project based on the codebase or documents present in that project directory.
