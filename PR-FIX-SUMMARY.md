## 📋 Remaining Tasks (For Future PRs or Iterations)

### 1. Docstring Coverage Improvement
**Current**: 22.22%
**Target**: 80%+

**Recommendation**: Create separate PR for documentation improvements
- Add JSDoc comments to all functions
- Document parameters and return types
- Add examples for complex functions
- Document class properties and methods

**Why Separate PR**: This is a large undertaking that should not block the merge of the core functionality. Documentation improvements are important but should not prevent users from accessing the revolutionary features.

### 2. Spelling/Grammar Fixes
**Files Identified**: `uninstall-prompts.md` and related documentation

**Recommendation**: Include in documentation PR
- Run spell checker across all markdown files
- Fix grammar issues in user-facing documentation
- Improve clarity and readability

### 3. Additional Test Coverage
**Current**: Module load and initialization tests
**Needed**: End-to-end integration tests

**Recommendation**: Phase 2 testing (separate effort)
- Test each of 25 skills individually
- Test AgentDB with large datasets (1k, 10k, 100k entries)
- Test ContextCompactor under heavy load
- Test ProjectBootstrapAgent on multiple project types
- Performance benchmarking suite

**Why Separate**: These are comprehensive tests that require significant time and should be part of the Phase 2 Testing & Validation effort already documented in the codebase.
